Next to do is pull image ID's and assign to the products per recommendation below:

What i would do first is to get the imageID in an array.
$imagesForProduct = array({id}, {id}, {id}, ...);
Then we can look at a function for adding these images to the product.
function change_product_image($product_id, $imagesForProduct) {
/*This is the line of code you already have. In this case we use the first image in the array as the featured one. You can delete this line if the images in the array is only the "Other images"*/
    set_post_thumbnail($product_id, $imagesForProduct[0]);
    /*Because we use the first as a featured, we check if there is any more in the array, if there is we start adding them.*/
    if(sizeof($imagesForProduct) > 1) {
/*We already use the first image as the featured, so we remove that one. Delete this line if you dont want to have it have that way*/ 
        array_shift($image_id_array);
/*Then we set the rest of the images as the product gallery images*/
        update_post_meta($product_id, '_product_image_gallery', implode(',',$imagesForProduct)); 
    }
}
So to clarify you would then:
change_product_image({productID}, $imagesForProduct);



DELETE FROM `shewolfb_wp`.`wp_postmeta` WHERE (`meta_id` = '90804');
